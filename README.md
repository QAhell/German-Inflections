# German Inflections

This repository provides MySQL scripts that contain inflections of the German
words from Wiktionary.

At the moment it only contains proper *nouns*, *verbs* and *adjectives*.
One kind of nouns is missing and that is nouns derived from adjectives.
Their inflection is just like the inflection of adjectives so they don't
quite fit into the noun tables. You can construct these nouns from
the adjective tables.
